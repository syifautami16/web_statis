        <div class="desc"><p>Starbucks Coffee Indonesia opened its first store in Plaza Indonesia, 17 May 2002. As of January 2018, Starbucks Coffee Indonesia is now in 326 different locations all around major cities (22 cities), connecting to Indonesians one cup at a time.
            <br>
            Back home in our tasting room, we take these amazing coffees and mix them with beans from other regions. That’s how we create some of our most famous blends, like Starbucks® Pike Place Roast. We love all of these single-origin coffees and blends. More than that, we love to share our passion. So each day we feature one of these outstanding brewed coffees for you to enjoy.
